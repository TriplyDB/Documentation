# Supported vocabularies

TriplyETL includes out-of-the-box support for a large number of external vocabularies, enumerated in the table below. If you miss an external vocabulary in that table, then let us know via: <mailto:support@triply.cc>


With the latest update, TriplyETL vocabularies are now represented as `Vocabulary` objects, replacing the previous usage of objects with the type `IRI`. This change may necessitate adjustments to existing ETLs that utilize static vocabularies, such as `aat`. In this case, the vocabulary would need to be updated to `aat.toIri()` to ensure compatibility with the correct type.

See the [external vocabularies](./declarations.md#external-vocabularies) section for more information on how to use external vocabularies in ETL configuration.


The following table lists the currently supported vocabularies:

FOAF integrates three kinds of network: social networks of human collaboration, friendship and association; representational networks that describe a simplified view of a cartoon universe in factual terms, and information networks that use Web-based linking to share independently published descriptions of this inter-connected world. FOAF does not compete with socially-oriented Web sites; rather it provides an approach in which different sites can tell different parts of the larger story, and by which users can retain some control over their information in a non-proprietary format. |

It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. |
| Data Cube Vocabulary | 0.2 | Statistical data, multi-dimensional data sets| There are many situations where it would be useful to be able to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets and concepts. The Data Cube vocabulary provides a means to do this using the W3C [RDF](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/) (Resource Description Framework) standard. The model underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies [SDMX](http://sdmx.org/) (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations. The Data Cube vocabulary is a core foundation which supports extension vocabularies to enable publication of other aspects of statistical data flows or other multi-dimensional data sets. |

As SHACL shape graphs are used to validate that data graphs satisfy a set of conditions they can also be viewed as a description of the data graphs that do satisfy these conditions. Such descriptions may be used for a variety of purposes beside validation, including user interface building, code generation and data integration. |
