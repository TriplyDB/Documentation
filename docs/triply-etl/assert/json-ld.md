# JSON-LD Assert

The JSON-LD standard includes the following algorithms that allow linked data to be added to the internal store:

1. The Expansion algorithm allows a JSON-LD context to be applied to the record.
2. The Deserialization algorithm allows linked data to be generated based on the expanded record.

THIS DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE SOON.
