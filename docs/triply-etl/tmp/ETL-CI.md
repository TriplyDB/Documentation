This document explains how to maintain an ETL that runs in the gitlab CI.


# How to create a TriplyETL CI pipeline?

- Use the TriplyETL boilerplate from [this repository](https://git.triply.cc/triply/boilerplates), specifically the etl folder.
- Each customer organization in gitlab needs their own 'CI runner'. If you're adding a TriplyETL repo to an existing customer, then you're probably fine. But if this is a newly created organisation, you will need to register a runner for this organisation.
  - To check whether the customer organisation has a runner configured, go to the customer organisation `Settings` in gitlab, then go to `CI/CD`. The URL should look something like this: `https://git.triply.cc/groups/customers/<customer-name>/-/settings/ci_cd`. Click `Runners` and verify that `Available runners:` is not zero.
  - If you need to register a runner, contact a sysadmin (see [here](https://git.triply.cc/triply/documentation/-/wikis/pages/server-calamities/index#for-triply-members) for the list of sysadmins) and ask them to create a runner for your organisation.

# Modifying a pipeline

To change what happens in a CI pipeline, all you need to do is modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file of your repository.

Below we detail some relevant `.gitlab-ci.yml` fields that are used in most of our ETL pipelines (see [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/) for the complete gitlab documentation on what all these fields mean)

### `artifacts:`
Artifacts are files or directories that gitlab will save for you. These files are available on the gitlab pipelines page after a job ran. This is particularly useful for TriplyETL error/log files, as you download these from the gitlab UI.

### `variables:`
You can define environment variables in several places. In the `.gitlab.yml` file, you can configure them at a job level or for all jobs. You can also configure them in the gitlab UI in the pipeline schedule form. Variables defined in a pipeline schedule will overwrite variables defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html#cicd-variable-precedence) for the gitlab documentation on variable precedence).

### `script:`
This is the code that will run in the job. If you need a job to run two TriplyETL commands after each other, you can easily add another `yarn etl ....` line here.

### `only:`
This defines *when* a job should run. If a job does not have an `only:` configure, it will always run. See [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#only--except) for documentation about the syntax of `only`). The boilerplate comes with some example `only:` rules that look like this:
```yml
  only:
    variables:
      - $JOB == "$CI_JOB_NAME"
```
This means that we only run this job if there a `JOB` environment variable that is the same as `CI_JOB_NAME`. Notice that the `CI_JOB_NAME` is a default environment variable that gitlab gives us and that equals the name of the job, e.g. `production` (see other predefined variables [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)).  If you want to run this specific job, `JOB` is the environment variable that you should set in the pipeline schedule page. In other words, if you set `JOB=production` in the pipeline schedule page, then using the above `only:` rule, only the intended job will run.




# FAQ

### Why does my pipeline schedule only run an `install` job?

This probably means that none of the `only:` rules in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file match. You should check whether the variables you've set in the pipelines schedules page match with the `only:` rules in your .gitlab-ci.yml file.

### I made a change to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and after I push I see a pipeline failed with status `yaml invalid`. How can I fix this?

Copy-past your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file [here](https://git.triply.cc/triply/ratt/-/ci/lint) and press `validate`. This should show in more details what is wrong with the yml file.

### Why is my pipeline not running and marked as 'pending'?

This probably means that you have not configured an ETL runner for this customer organisation yet. See the section about getting started [here](#how-to-create-a-ratt-ci-pipeline)

### What do all these `$CI_...` environment variables mean?

These are environment variables added by gitlab. To see what they mean, go to [this](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) gitlab documentation page, also mentioned above.

### What should I do when the pipeline fail when I commit in a personal project?

In a personal repository, you have available runners, but shared ones. Thus, your pipelines will fail. This is expected and it is not an issue. You can either ignore the failed pipeline or remove `gitlab-ci.yml` from the repository.
