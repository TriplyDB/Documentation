**Features**
- `#8502` [SPARQL IDE] Add confirmation mechanisms in the browser to avoid the browser rendering too much information. This avoids issues where the browser is rendered unresponsive

**Features**

- `#4209` Add queries overview page for TriplyDB administrators

- `#8558` `#8556`:[SPARQL speedy] Improve performance of queries with `filter not exists` and `optionals` by 30% to 180%.



**Issues fixed**

    - The new editor is backwards compatible with the old editor.
    - The geo-events plugin (where geographic information can be rendered as a timeline) is deprecated and not present in the SPARQL IDE.
- `#8420` `#8457` [SPARQL speedy] Improve performance of most SPARQL queries with 40% to 200%
