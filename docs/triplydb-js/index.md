[TOC]

**TriplyDB.js** is the official programming library for interacting with [TriplyDB](/triply-db-getting-started). TriplyDB.js allows you to automate operations that would otherwise be performed in the TriplyDB GUI.

TriplyDB.js is implemented in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). TypeScript is a type-safe language that transpiles to [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). This allows you to use TriplyDB.js in web browsers as well as on servers (using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)). TriplyDB.js is open source and its source code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/TriplyDB/TriplyDB-JS).

# Overview

TriplyDB.js contains several classes, each with their own methods. The documentation for every method includes at least one code example. These code examples can be run by inserting them into the following overall script.

Notice that `process.env.TOKEN` picks up an API token that is stored in the environment variable called `TOKEN`. Follow the steps on [this page](/triply-api/#creating-an-api-token) to create a new API token in the TriplyDB GUI.

```ts
require('source-map-support/register')
import App from '@triply/triplydb'
const triply = App.get({ token: process.env.TOKEN })
async function run() {
  // This is where the code examples in this reference section should be placed.
}
run().catch(e => {
  console.error(e)
  process.exit(1)
})
process.on('uncaughtException', function (e) {
  console.error('Uncaught exception', e)
  process.exit(1)
})
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) => {
  console.error('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise', p, 'reason:', reason)
  process.exit(1)
})
```

The following sections document the various TriplyDB.js classes. Each class comes with its own methods. Classes are related through methods that connect them. For example, calling the `getAccount` method on a `App` object returns an `Account` object.
