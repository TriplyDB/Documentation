## Access levels

TriplyDB uses the following access levels for datasets, queries, and
stories.

| **Access level** | **Description**                                                                           | **Icon**          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Private          | The dataset/query/story is only visible to you.                                           | ![](private.png)  |
| Internal         | The dataset/query/story is only visible to people who are logged in to the same TriplyDB. | ![](internal.png) |
| Public           | The dataset/query/story is visible to everybody on the Internet.                          | ![](public.png)   |

### Access level dependencies

The access levels for datasets, queries, and stories may affect each
other. For example, if a public query references a private dataset,
other users will be able to view the query string, but none of the
query results. TriplyDB always uses the most conservative access
level in such cases, ensuring that information is never exposed
unintentionally.

### Access levels and workflows

These access levels are often used for the following workflow:

- You create a new dataset/query/story starts with access level
  ‘Private’.
- As the dataset/query/story progresses, give it access level
  ‘Internal’ to receive feedback from other users.
- Once the dataset/query/story is ready, give it access level
  ‘Public’ to publish it to the world.

## Markdown support

Triply allows rich text formatting to be used in the following places:

- Dataset description
- Account description
- Saved Query description
- Data Story elements
- Site welcome message

The following Markdown elements are supported:

### Headings

Headings are used to divide a text into different sections. The hash
character (`#`) at the beginning of a line indicates a heading is
used. Multiple hash characters indicate nested headings.

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

### Text styling

| _Style_       | _Syntax_            | _Output_          |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`          | **bold**          |
| Italic        | `_italic_`          | _italic_          |
| Strikethrough | `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |

### Hyperlinks

| _Style_     | _Syntax_                     | _Output_                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Raw URL     | `<https://triply.cc>`        | <https://triply.cc>        |
| Labeled URL | `[label](https://triply.cc)` | [label](https://triply.cc) |

Notice that URLs can also be relative. This allows you to refer to
other datasets, saved queries, etc. by using relative paths.

### Code

There are options for formatting in-line code as well as multi-line
code blocks.

#### In-line code

Code can also be used in-line with single backticks:

```md
Use `code` inside a sentence.
```

#### Multi-line code blocks

Multi-line code blocks start and end with three consecutive backticks.
The following Markdown denotes two lines of Turtle:

<pre>
```sparql
select * {
  graph ?g {
    ?s ?p ?o.
  }
}
```
</pre>

The above is rendered as follows:

```sparql
select * {
  graph ?g {
    ?s ?p ?o.
  }
}
```

#### Code language

The opening backticks are optionally following by the name of the code
language. The following code languages are supported:

| **Language** | **Syntax**   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| SPARQL       | `sparql`     |
| Turtle       | `ttl`        |
| TypeScript   | `typescript` |
| R            | `r`          |
| Python       | `python`     |

The other supported languages are: Bash (`bash`), C (`c`), C++
(`cpp`), C# (`csharp`), Extended Backus-Naur Form (`ebnf`), Go (`go`),
Haskell (`haskell`), Java (`java`), JavaScript (`javascript`), LaTeX
(`latex`), Makefile (`makefile`), Markdown (`markdown`), Objective C
(`objectivec`), Pascal (`pascal`), Perl (`perl`), Powershell
(`powershell`), Prolog (`prolog`), Regular Expression (`regex`), Ruby
(`ruby`), Scala (`scala`), SQL (`sql`), Yaml (`yaml`).
