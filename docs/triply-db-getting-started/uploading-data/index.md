# Uploading Data

This section explains how to create a linked dataset in TriplyDB.

## Creating a new dataset

The following steps allow a new linked datasets to be created:

1. Log into a TriplyDB instance.

2. Click the `+` button on the dataset pane that appears on the
   right-hand side of the home screen.

3. This brings up the dialog for creating a new dataset. Enter a
   dataset name that consists of alpha-numeric characters
   (`A-Za-z0-9`) and hyphens (`-`).

4. Optionally, enter a dataset display name. This name will be used
   in the GUI and will be exposed in dataset metadata.

5. Optionally, enter a dataset description. You can use rich text
   formatting by using Markdown. See [our section about
   Markdown](#markdown-support) for details.

6. Optionally, change the access level for the dataset. By default
   this is set to “Private”. See [dataset access
   levels](#access-levels) for more information.

When datasets are Public (see [Access Levels](#access-levels)), they
automatically expose metadata and are automatically crawled and
indexed by popular search engines (see [Metadata](#metadata)).

## Adding data

Once the dataset is created, the “Add data” view is displayed (see
screenshot). In this view data can be added in three ways:

<dl>
  <dt>File upload</dt>
  <dd>Select files from your local machine.  It is also possible to drag-and-drop local files on the cloud icon with the upward pointing arrow.</dd>
  <dt>URL upload</dt>
  <dd>Copy/paste a URL that points to an online RDF file.</dd>
  <dt>Import</dt>
  <dd>Import a dataset that is already published in the same TriplyDB instance.</dd>
</dl>

The “Add data” view is also available for existing datasets:

1. Go to the “Graphs” view by clicking on the graph icon in the
   left-hand sidebar.

2. Click the “Import a new graph” button.

### Adding data: File upload

The file upload feature allows you to upload RDF files from your local
machine. This can be done in either of two ways:

- Click on the cloud icons to open a dialog that allows local RDF
  files from your machine to be selected.

- Drag-and-drop RDF files from your local machine onto the cloud
  icon.

The following RDF serialization formats are currently supported:

| **Serialization Format** | **File extension**     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| N-Quads                  | `.nq`                  |
| N-Triples                | `.nt`                  |
| RDF/XML                  | `.rdf`, `.owl`, `.owx` |
| TriG                     | `.trig`                |
| Turtle                   | `.ttl`, `.n3`          |
| JSON-LD                  | `.jsonld`, `.json`     |

Up to 1,000 separate files can be uploaded in one go. It is also
possible to upload compressed files and archives. When the number of
files exceeds 1,000, it is more efficient to combine them in archives
and upload those. This allows an arbitrary number of files to be
uploaded. The following archive/compression formats are currently
supported:

| **Format** | **File extensions** |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| gzip       | `.gz`               |
| bzip2      | `.bz2`              |
| tar        | `tar`               |
| XZ         | `.xz`               |
| ZIP        | `.zip`              |

### Adding data by URL upload

The second option for adding data is to include it from an online URL
location. This is done by entering the URL inside the “Add data from
a URL” text field.

### Adding data by import

The third option for adding data is to import from datasets that are
published in the same TriplyDB instance. This is done with the “Add
data from an existing dataset” dropdown list (see screenshot).

### Adding malformed data

TriplyDB only allows valid RDF data to be added. If data is malformed,
TriplyDB will show an error message that indicates which part of the
RDF data is malformed (see screenshot). If such malformed data is
encountered, the RDF file must first be corrected and uploaded again.

TriplyDB follows the linked data standards strictly. Many triple
stores allow incorrect RDF data to be added. This may seem convenient
during the loading phase, but often results in errors when
standards-compliant tools start using the data.

## Assets: binary data

Not all data can be stored as RDF data. For example images and video
files use a binary format. Such files can also be stored in TriplyDB
and can be integrated into the Knowledge Graph.
