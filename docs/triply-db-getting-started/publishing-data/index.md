# Sharing data

With TriplyDB you can easily make your data available to the outside world.

## Sharing your dataset

You can share your dataset by setting the visibility to “Public” in
the dataset settings menu. Making a dataset public in TriplyDB has
the following consequences:

1. The dataset can be searched for and visited by anybody on the web.
2. The dataset will be indexed by web search engines such as Google
   Dataset Search.
3. Any services that are started for that dataset will be available
   to anybody on the web. This includes SPARQL, Text
   Search, and Linked Data Fragments.

## Dataset settings page

The dataset settings page can be accessed from any dataset page. It appears as the last item in the menu to the left (see [Figure 1](#fig-dataset-homepage)).

</figure>

The dataset settings page contains the following items:

- [Update dataset profile](#update-dataset-profile)
- Prefixes <!-- TODO: [](#prefixes) -->
- Transfer ownership <!-- TODO: [](#transfer-ownership) -->
- Delete dataset <!-- TODO: [](#delete-dataset) -->
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)

### Update dataset profile

The "Update dataset profile" pane (see [Figure 2](#fig-update-dataset-profile-pane)) allows the following things to be configured:

- Dataset Access Level, see Section [Access Levels](../reference/index.md#access-levels).
- Dataset metadata, see Section [Dataset metadata](#dataset-metadata).

### Dataset metadata

Adding metadata for your datasets is important. This makes it easier to find your dataset later and also allows search engines and social media applications to understand your dataset.

The "Update dataset profile" pane allows the following metadata to be configured:

- Dataset name
- Dataset slug
- Dataset description
- Example resources
- License
- Avatar

Within the TriplyDB instance your dataset is now more findable for users. Whenever a user searches on one of the topics of your dataset, or types in a word that is present in the description of your dataset, the dataset will be shown as a search result. The metadata will allow TriplyDB to give a better impression of your dataset when a user visits. [Figure 3](#fig-dataset-homepage-with-metadata) shows the dataset homepage of a dataset for which metadata has been configured.

<figure id="fig-dataset-homepage-with-metadata">
  <img src="../../assets/dataset-homepage-with-metadata.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 3. The dataset homepage of a dataset with configured metadata.</figcaption>
</figure>

Search engines and social media applications can recognize the metadata that is entered for datasets in TriplyDB. [Figure 4](#fig-slack-widget) shows an example of a Social Media widget in the Slack chat application. Such widgets are automatically generated upon entering the link to a public dataset in TriplyDB. The chat application in [Figure 4](#fig-slack-widget) understands the metadata properties: title, description, and image. Different Social Media applications may make use of different metadata properties.

## Starting services

By default, datasets in TriplyDB can be queried through [TriplyDB-js](../../triplydb-js/index.md) as well as through the Linked Data Fragments API.

In order to allow additional query paradigms, specific services can be
started from the “Create service” page. This page is accessed by
clicking on the “Services” icon in the left-hand sidebar.

TriplyDB instances can be configured with different types of services.
The below screenshot shows the “Create service” page for a TriplyDB
instance that allows SPARQL, Jena SPARQL, and Elasticsearch services
to be created.

![The “Create service” page](../../assets/create-service.png) Notice that three different types of services can be created.

It is possible to create multiple services for one dataset.

### Existing services

Existing services are displayed on service widgets (see screenshot).
From these widgets, services can be created or deleted.

![An example of a service widget](../../assets/service-widget.png)

Datasets can change whenever a graph is added, deleted or renamed. When this
happens, the data in a service is out of sync with the data in the dataset and
a synchronization button will appear in the service widget. By clicking the
button, the service will be synchronized with the current state of the dataset.

## Webhooks

If you want to be notified or trigger an event when anything changes in your dataset, you can set up a webhook.

The webhook page can be found under dataset's settings on the right, as shown in the image below.

![Webhooks settings page](../../assets/webhook.png)

To create a webhook, you will need to provide the following information:

- `Payload target`: The URL to which the webhook message should be sent.
- `Payload format`: The format of the message.
- `Trigger events`: Select for which event you wish to trigger the webhook. The options are:
  - **Graph import**: Happens when data is imported from a different dataset and where the data is already stored on the instance.
  - **Linked data upload**: Happens when a person uploads data to the instance. The data did not exist on the instance before.
  - **Asset upload**: Happens when an asset is uploaded.


You can activate or deactivate the webhook with the slider after the `Webhook is active` message.

After filling in everything, you can click on the `SUBMIT` button and the new webhook will be activated.

For example, if you wish to trigger a pipeline on gitlab every time you upload an asset to your dataset, you can use the below snippet as a payload target, as described on the [official gitlab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/) and select `Asset upload` as a trigger event.

```
https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/trigger/pipeline?token=<token>&ref=<ref_name>
```
When your webhook is created and active, you can see every occasion the webhook was called in the webhook trigger history.
