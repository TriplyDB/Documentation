# Editing Data

The Editor is available in specific instances of TriplyDB. It allows creating, updating or deleting data that have a structure that is defined in a [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes graph. For example, a shapes graph could define the structure of a concept scheme based on [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/), or it could define the structure of a data catalogue based on [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/). 

This section describes using the Editor to edit SKOS concept schemes as an example. The Editor works in a similar way for other views.

In order to open the Editor, select the dataset that you want to work with. If your instance provides the feature, you will see "Editor" on the left-hand side. Pressing there will open the Editor pane.

Alternatively, instance hyperlinks can be dragged and dropped on the "Editor" menu entry, to directly view the instance in the Editor.

## About Editor forms

The Editor uses forms to create or edit instances of a class. The image below shows elements of a form.

![Editor form](../../assets/editor-form.png)

In Editor forms, an asterisk (*) is used to mark mandatory properties of an instance. It is not possible to save resources that do not have a value for all mandatory properties.

In order to add a property, press the  plus symbol (+). Some properties can occur multiple times, with different values.

In order to remove a property, press the waste basket symbol.

Input fields for values support dropdown lists where possible. Alternatively, it is possible to start typing to bring up a list of matching values. The availabilty of dropdown lists is indicated by a small downward facing triangle on the right of the input field.

## Choosing an Editor view

In the top left corner of the Editor pane, the _view_ button can be used to select a different view, if multiple views are configured. The image below shows the SKOS view being selected.

![Choose an Editor view](../../assets/editor-view-skos.png)

## Creating a new instance
In the top right corner of the Editor pane you can find the _create_ button. It can be used to create a new instance of a class that is defined in the shapes graph.

![Create a new instance](../../assets/editor-create.png)

Pressing the _create_ button will open a form that allows picking the class for the new instance, and setting other properties. By default, each resource needs to have an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier). The Editor generates an IRI, which can be changed, if needed.

## Finding an instance

Next to the _create_ button there is an input box that can be used to find an instance based on its label. All data that are configured to be used by the Editor are included in the search. You can start typing to populate a dropdown list with resources that have a matching sequence of characters somewhere. The matching characters are displayed in boldface.

## SKOS: selecting concept schemes

In the SKOS view, it is possible to select a concept scheme to work with. Press the _concept scheme(s)_ input field to choose a concept scheme from a dropdown list. Alternatively, start typing to find a concept scheme with a matching character sequence.

![Select a concept scheme](../../assets/editor-select-concept-scheme.png)

SKOS concept schemes are allowed to be chained, by means of [skos:narrowMatch](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#narrowMatch) and [skos:broadMatch](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broadMatch) relations between concepts. Once a concept scheme is found, you can press in the space behind its name to find and select nested concept schemes. Concept schemes in the chain will be assigned different colours, as shown in the image below.

![Expand the concept scheme](../../assets/editor-chained-concept-schemes.png)

## SKOS: navigating concept schemes

Once one or more concept schemes have been selected, the hierarchy of concepts and concept schemes is displayed in a tree view:

![The concepts hierarchy](../../assets/editor-concept-tree.png)

The symbol __>__ in front of a concept means that the concept has underlying elements. Pressing __>__ will expand the concept. The symbol will then point downward to show that the concept has been expanded. When a concept has no underlying concepts, its name is preceded by a dot (â€¢).

As concepts can be defined in different nested concept schemes, the coloured label of the concept scheme is displayed for each concept.

To search within the concept hierarchy, use the _Search in hierarchy_ input field.

When a concept in the concept hierarchy is selected, detailled information is displayed on the right-hand side of the Editor pane.

## Instance details

When an instance (for example, a SKOS concept) is selected on the left side of the Editor pane, a description of the instance is shown on the right:

![Instance details](../../assets/editor-instance-details.png)

Below the name of the instance, its IRI is displayed as a hyperlink (blue underlined). The hyperlink can be dragged and dropped on other visualisation in TriplyDB, like _Browser_ or _Triples_. To the right of the instance hyperlink its class is shown.

For instances that have been edited in the Editor, a history of changes is recorded. Details of the last change are shown by _Modified by_ and
_Modified_. The symbol of the backward turning clock can be pressed to show the complete modification history of the selected instance. The image below shows an example.

![Instance modification history](../../assets/editor-history.png)

### Copying an instance

The _copy_ button can be used to copy an instance. That can be useful if a new instance is needed that is similar to an existing one.

### Editing an instance

The _edit_ button can be used to edit the properties of an instance.

### Deleting an instance

To remove an instance, press the _delete_ button. You will be asked for a confirmation before the instance is really deleted.
