Data Stories allows a sequence of SPARQL queries to be published
within an HTML document.

Examples can be found [here](https://stories.triply.cc)

## Getting Started

To get started with Data Stories contact us at [info@triply.cc](info@triply.cc)

### Minimal working example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="author" content="{{FIRST-AUTHOR}}, {{SECOND-AUTHOR}}, …" />
    <meta name="description" content="{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories ― {{STORY-TITLE}}" />
    <title>{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories ― {{STORY-TITLE}}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{LINK-TO-STORIES-CSS}}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <query data-query-ref="test.rq" endpoint="https://demo.triply.cc/datasets/academy/sparql/services/sparql/sparql">
    </query>
    <script src="{{LINK-TO-STORIES-JS}}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.onload = function() {
        window.stories();
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Best Practices

#### Markup language declaration

Data Stories are written in HTML 5. This is declared at the beginning
of the document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

#### Main natural language declaration

The natural language in which most of the Data Story will be written
is declared in the `lang` attribute of the outer `html` tag:

```html
<html lang="en-us">
  …
</html>
```

Specific (sub)sections of a Data Story that are written in another
main natural language must declare this on the corresponding tag.

#### Encoding declaration

Since Data Stories are encoded in UTF-8, this is declared at the
beginning of the `head` content:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  …
</head>
```

Placement at the beginning of the `head` is required, since User
Agents may apply limited lookahead in order to determine the document
encoding. Placing the encoding declaration later in the `head`
content may result in some User Agents not detecting it.

#### Metadata

The `author` and `description` meta tags must both be supplied as
children of the `head` tag, and their content must be structured
according to the below template. The `title` tag must have the same
content as the `description` meta tag.

```html
<head>
  …
  <meta name="author" content="{{FIRST-AUTHOR}}, {{SECOND-AUTHOR}}, …" />
  <meta name="description" content="{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories ― {{STORY-TITLE}}" />
  <title>{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories ― {{STORY-TITLE}}</title>
  …
</head>
```

#### Navigation bar

Data Stories contain a navigation bar that allows users to return to
the Data Stories overview page.

```html
<body class="withNavbar">
  <nav class="navbar fixed-top ">
    <div class="navbar-content">
      <div class="navbar-icon">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">
          <img alt="{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories home" src="/assets/imgs/{{INSTANCE}}-logo-square.png" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <div class="navbar-title">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">{{INSTANCE}} Data Stories</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
  …
</body>
```

#### External links

Links that appear in the Data Story and that link to other web pages
must be specified in the following way:

```html
<a href="…" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">…</a>
```

Every link that contains `target="_blank"` is susceptible to reverse
tabnagging, a serious security vulnerability explained in [this
article](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/)

Attribute `rel="noopener"` is a relatively new feature, available
since Chrome 49 (2016-03-02), Firefox 52 (2017-03-07), and Safari 10.1
(2017-03-27). It is not supported by Microsoft browsers.

In old and/or Microsoft browsers `rel="noreferrer"` can be used to
achieve a similar effect: it prevents the `Referrer` HTTP header from
being sent.

## Components

Data Stories defines the following two HTML elements:

- `<div class="story">` :: The tag that contains zero or more
  `<query>` tags and that implements the Data Story.

- `<query>` :: The tag that implements one query within the Data
  Story.

### Story

The following attributes are defined on a `<div class="story">`
element:


- `data-endpoint`: The URI of the SPARQL endpoint against which all queries in the Data Story are executed.

- `data-output`: The output format that is used to display SPARQL
  result sets in. The following values are
  supported:

  <dl>
    <dt>raw</dt>
    <dd>The textual content of the HTTP reply body. For
      example, the SPARQL result set serialized in XML, JSON,
      or CSV.</dd>

    <dt>table</dt>
    <dd>Shows the results in rows of an HTML table. This is
      the default value.</dd>
    <dt>boolean</dt>
    <dd>Shows the result of an `ask` query.</dd>
    <dt>error</dt>
    <dd>Display the error value.</dd>
    <dt>gallery</dt>
    <dd>Shows HTML widgets in card rows.</dd>
    <dt>gchart</dt>
    <dd>Shows a UI for selecting numeric properties in order
      to generate various diagrams.</dd>
    <dt>geo</dt>
    <dd>Shows GeoSPARQL results on a 2D map.</dd>
    <dt>geo3d</dt>
    <dd>Shows GeoSPARQL results on a 3D map.</dd>
    <dt>pivot</dt>
    <dd>Shows a UI for selecting numeric properties in order
      to generate various diagrams and pivot tables.</dd>
  </dl>

### Query

The following attributes are defined on the `query` element:

- `data-config-ref="URI"`: The URI of a saved query in TriplyDB.

- `data-config="URI"`: A URI that encodes a query together with
  the configuration of a specific view. These URIs can be
  created within the SPARQL IDE.

- `data-endpoint="URI"`: The URI of the SPARQL endpoint against
  which a particular query is evaluated. When absent, the value
  of this attribute on the `<div class="story">` tag is used.

- `data-query-ref="URI"`: An absolute or relative URI to a file
  that stores a SPARQL query.

- `data-output="VALUE"`: The output format that is used to display
  the SPARQL result set. When absent, the value of this
  attribute on the `<div class="story">` tag is used. See the
  documentation of the Story element for the supported values.

- `data-show-query`: By default, the query editor is hidden. When
  this attribute is present, the query editor is shown.

### Stacked story

Stacked stories are an alternative to tell a story and uses a document.

![Example of a stacked story](https://stories.triply.cc/pok%C3%A9mon/)

A stacked story is initialized by an article tag with the following attributes

```html
<article data-stacked="true"></article>
```

Each item of the stacked story is a section with therein a header and a [query](#Query) element

```html
<article data-stacked="true">
  <section data-title="Which Pokémon has the most experience?">
    <header>
      This SPARQL query shows the Pokémon, sorted by their experience.
    </header>
    <query data-query-ref="./query/gallery.rq" data-output="gallery"></query>
    <section></section>
  </section>
</article>
```

The title of the section is set by the `data-title` attribute in the `section` element
