# Unleashing the Power of OpenAPI Specifications: TriplyDB's Step Forward in RESTful API Development


We are excited to announce that TriplyDB has taken a major leap forward by incorporating OpenAPI specifications into its arsenal of features! With this latest enhancement, TriplyDB now allows users to expose their saved queries using the OpenAPI specification, effectively transforming TriplyDB into a self-documenting REST API.

TriplyDB has always provided the ability to save queries, allowing users to store and reuse their frequently used queries. These saved queries were already mapped to paths in the REST API, making it convenient for users to access them programmatically. However, TriplyDB has now gone a step further by enhancing the existing API query paths to return OpenAPI specifications in YAML format when requested by the users.

So, what exactly are OpenAPI specifications? In simple terms, they are a standardized way of describing RESTful APIs. They provide a language- and framework-agnostic format for describing the endpoints, request and response formats, authentication mechanisms, and other important details of an API. OpenAPI specifications are typically written in YAML or JSON format, which makes them easy to read and understand by both humans and machines. In addition, they provide standardized ways of describing APIs, serve as documentation and allow interoperability and communication between different APIs.

The incorporation of OpenAPI specifications into TriplyDB is a big step towards making TriplyDB a more powerful and user-friendly platform for building RESTful APIs. We are excited about the possibilities that this enhancement brings and look forward to seeing how our users leverage the power of OpenAPI specifications in TriplyDB!
