For example, when searching for datasets, you can filter your results by service, number of statements (triples), topic, license, owner organization, time of creation, or even access type. This means that you can easily find the datasets that meet your specific needs, without having to scroll through hundreds of irrelevant results.

Similarly, when searching for queries, you can filter by the datasets they belong to, the specific visualizations they contain, the owner organizations, creation date, or access type they were given. This makes it easier to find the queries that are relevant to your particular use case.

And finally, stories also have the Faceted Search option available. You can filter your results by the datasets and queries related to that story, the owner organization the stories belong to, the creation time, or the access type they have. This means that you can quickly find the stories that are relevant to your interests.

Here is an example of using faceted search to look for all datasets containing the keyword "library":
