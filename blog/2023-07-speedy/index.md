# Speedy: New SPARQL Engine in TriplyDB

We're thrilled to announce that TriplyDB has taken a significant leap forward with the introduction of Speedy, a new SPARQL engine. Say goodbye to waiting for services to start – Speedy is always up and running, ensuring instant access to the freshest data for your queries

# What is Speedy?

Speedy is a SPARQL engine integrated into the TriplyDB ecosystem. It's not just another tool; it's a dynamic solution that addresses the limitations of traditional services offered in TriplyDB. 

In the past, users would click a button to start a service, and depending on the size of data, it could take hours or even days for the service to start. Speedy, on the other hand, is always running service, always up to date, and ready to assist you whenever you need it.

# Advantages of Speedy

One of the most significant advantages of Speedy is its seamless integration into TriplyDB. Unlike older services, which required manual intervention to restart when data changed, Speedy eliminates this inconvenient process. 
With Speedy, your data is automatically kept up to date,  without any manual process. It's like having a personal data assistant that never takes a break!

# User-Friendly Experience

Using Speedy is as easy as working with any other TriplyDB service. You can simply select your options and start querying your data. Speedy takes care of the rest, delivering results quickly and efficiently. No more waiting around for services to start; Speedy is always there to provide you with the answers you need.

# Raising the Standard

While Virtuoso may be one of the most commonly used services in TriplyDB, it doesn't always adhere to SPARQL standards as rigorously as Speedy does. Many queries that work for Virtuoso may not work on Speedy, and this is actually a good thing. It indicates that those queries are not syntactically correct or aligned with SPARQL standards.

Speedy ensures that your queries are not only accurate but also maintain the integrity of your data. It's a safeguard against potential errors and inconsistencies that can arise when using services that don't follow the established norms.

In essence, Speedy sets a new standard for SPARQL querying within TriplyDB. It prioritizes accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to standards, making it the go-to choice for users who demand the best from their linked data queries.

In conclusion, Speedy represents a significant advancement in SPARQL querying within TriplyDB. It offers unparalleled efficiency, accuracy, and adherence to standards, setting a new benchmark for linked data queries. Say goodbye to waiting for services to start –  go to [TriplyDB](https://triplydb.com/) and try Speedy today to experience instant access to the freshest data for your queries.
