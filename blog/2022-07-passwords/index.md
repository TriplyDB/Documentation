In the latest TriplyDB release, we encourage people to write good passwords. But what constitutes a good password, and how do we encourage people to write such passwords?

The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov) is a U.S. government science laboratory, and considered an authority in the are of Information Security. ISO standards such as ISO 27001 often take inspiration from NIST guidelines.
NIST published a guideline for digital identity management[^1] that covers the topic of password composition and validation.  

In this blog we'll discuss what this guideline means in practice, and how this is implemented in TriplyDB





## What does a good password look like?{#best}

A good password should be difficult to guess, both by an automated script or via a person via e.g. [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)).

The NIST guideline and corresponding literature[^2][^3] provide several suggestions:

1. The larger the password, the higher the entropy, maling it difficult to guess the password. A password like `uTxyyDGXxnYsbWy4g6Ma` is preferable over `1Jix5bQi`.
2. The more diverse characters used, the [better](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#a3-complexity). That means we don't have to stick to letters, numbers and punctuation marks, but we can even include smileys (üòÄ) or other unicode characters (‚ù§‚õîüëÄ).
3. A good password should not be leaked: There are corpuses available (such as [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com)) that includes leaked passwords gathered from data breaches of popular websites. As some people tend to re-use passwords between websites, such corpuses may leave them vulnerable to attack. If john@doe.com resuses the same password for many websites, and one of this website has been breached, then all others accounts of John Doe will be vulnerable.
4. Avoid using dictionary words, particularly for shorter passwords. Having dictionary words only would leave you vulnerable to a brute-force attach where an automated script repeatedly tries to enter a password using commonly-used words.
5. The password should not include repetitive or sequential characters. Examples are `aaaaaa`, `12345`, or even `asdfg` (letters close to each other on your keyboard). Such passwords are too easy to guess
6. Context-specific words should not be allowed as they are too easy to guess. Examples are using the word `TriplyDB` or your username in the password.


## Examples of bad password policies.

Implementing a password policy that satisfies the above suggestions is difficult. As a result, there are many password policies in use that we'd advocate against. Examples of such policies:

### Requiring a particular set of characters

A typical measure for encouraging stronger passwords is requiring a particular set of characters. This is called an *explicit* password policy. E.g., at minimum one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit and one symbol. As shown in research related to password testing metrics[^4], users tend to go for predictable passwords when such policies are enforced. If a user would have wanted to use a password `password`, she'd by relatively likely choose a password like `Password1!` as an alternative to satisfy the criteria.

### Rotating passwords

Some organization force users to rotate their password every several months. The intent of such password rotation mechanism is to avoid the threat that a password is compromised by a leak on other websites (given that some passwords may be re-used accross websites).
That means that the longer a password is in use and not renewed, the larger the chance of the password being exposed. 

The problem with such password rotation policies is that users tend to choose a weaker password when they know they'll have to change it in the near future. For instance, users with the password `Password1!` may simply append the date they created the password and end up with `Password1~June22`

In addition to that, such password rotation policies have a great impact on usability. As a result users may get frustrated with such policies only to invent insecure workaround to cater to such policies.

## How Triply encourage good passwords TriplyDB

In general, a good password policy strikes a balance between maximizing security and usability. 
We implemented a password validator for TriplyDB that estimates the strength of a password and communicates this via a strength meter. When a password is not good enough, suggestions are given to the user on how to improve the password.

The TriplyDB password validator satisfies all of the NIST guidelines for password best practices, as listed in the [What does a good password look like?](#best) section above. Specifically:


1. Large passwords are encouraged. 
2. Any character is valid, not just numbers, letters and symbols.
3. Entered passwords are validated against previous breaches. TODO
4. The validator takes words from the dictionary into account. Using dictionary words will negatively impact the password score. Variants of dictionary words are also included, i.e. `P@ssword` will be recognized as the word `Password`.
5. Repetition of characters negatively influence the password score. This includes `aaaa`, `12345` and repetition using your keyboard layout such as `asdfg`
6. Context specific words will also negatively influence the password score.



## What's on the horizon 

A good password policy is an important part of securing TriplyDB and its accounts. That being said, there are other large improvements coming to make TriplyDB even more secure such as:

- Multi Factor Authentication
- Automatic notifications when we detect a login from a new IP.
