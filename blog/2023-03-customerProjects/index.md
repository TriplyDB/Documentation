# Triply and Het Nieuwe Instituut: A Successful Collaboration in Linked Data

We are excited to share some news about our recent project! Lately, Triply had the pleasure of working with HNI (Het Nieuwe Instituut) who required a linked data knowledge graph and a method of using that data on their website in a FAIR manner. As a company that works with linked data and knowledge graphs, we were happy to accept this challenge and apply our expertise to meet their requirements.

The customer was looking for a linked data knowledge graph that would help them to organize their data in a structured way where they could easily explore their data. We collaborated with the customer to determine their unique data sources and the relationships between them, to create a model that met their specific requirements.

By using our product – TriplyETL, we were able to extract, transform and load the data from different data sources to the knowledge graph. Our team made sure the ETL processes were effective and precise, giving the client access to a complete picture of their data.

Finally, we assisted the customer with using SPARQL queries on their website to access the data from the knowledge graph. They were able to represent their data in a FAIR way, making it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. This allowed users to quickly access the data and engage with it in a way that was meaningful and insightful to them.

We're proud of the work we've done, and you can check out the results of our efforts on the customer's website by following [this link](https://theotherinterface.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/). Our team was able to provide the client with a comprehensive solution that met their requirements and enabled them to use the data more effectively.

At Triply, we're always working on exciting projects like this one, helping our clients optimize their data management and integration processes. If your company needs data management and improved data quality, don't hesitate to contact us. We would love to see how we can assist you in achieving your objectives. Stay tuned for more updates on our latest projects. We are excited to continue to work with our clients to drive innovation in the field of linked data.
