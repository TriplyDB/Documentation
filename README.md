## Contributing

- Feel free to open issues with questions about the documentation.
- Feel free to create pull requests with adjustments or additions that you believe to be valuable.

## Available markdown

You are able to use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). As well as the following extensions

**Custom ID headers**:
By default ID's will be created from the content of a header, allowing deep linking to them using the #hash part of a URL.
```md
## My Header
```

This will result in link `http://docs.triply.cc/path-to-file/#my-header`.

Using the following syntax you are able to assign custom id's to headers if you do not want the default ID:

```md
## My Header {: #my-custom-header-id}
```
This will result in link `http://docs.triply.cc/path-to-file/#my-custom-header-id`.

## Guideline for authors
- Always start your page with a heading of level 1 (1 hashsign)
- Subheadings of level 2 (2 hashsigns) will appear as submenu on that page
- Level 1 links in the menu that only contain subpage will not be clickable until a developer creates a mapping in `docs/js/triply.js`

## Installation

This website uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to convert Markdown to HTML so the documentation can be viewed in a web browser. Follow the instructions on their website to install MkDocs.

Required plugins:
- To render `mermaid` you will need to install [this plugin](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin).

The following steps often work/suffice:
1. Install Python and Pip.
2. Run `pip install mkdocs`
3. Run `pip install mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin`
4. Run `pip install mkdocs-redirects`

## Building and running the Documentation website

After you have successfully installed MkDocs, you can run a local web server with the following command (run from the root of this repository):

```sh
mkdocs serve --strict
```

To build a static HTML website for deployment, run this command:

```sh
mkdocs build
```
This will generate the required HTML and CSS in a folder `./site`.


To publish this website, push your changes to the master branch. The live documentation site should be updated shortly after that. If there are any errors, you can find more details in [the GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TriplyDB/Documentation/actions).

### Notes about syntax highlighting
This project uses [highlightjs.org](https://highlightjs.org) for rendering code blocks with syntax highlighting. This projects does not have support for Turtle/SPARQL by default. We use a custom build to provide syntax highlighting for these.

```sh
mkdir Highlight.js
cd Highlight.js
git clone https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js.git
git clone https://github.com/mightymax/highlightjs-turtle.git
cd highlight.js/src/languages
ln -s ../../../highlightjs-turtle/src/sparql.js
ln -s ../../../highlightjs-turtle/src/turtle.js
cd ../../
node tools/build.js turtle sparql typescript javascript
cp build/highlight.min.js <path-to-this-repo>/js
cp build/demo/styles/intellij-light.css <path-to-this-repo>/css
```
