## Building and running the Documentation website
This website uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to convert Markdown to HTML so the documentation can be veiwed in a webbrowser. Follow the instructions on their website to isnatll MkDocs. After you've sucessfully installed MkDocs, you can run a local webserver with the following command (run from the toot of this repository):
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

To build a static HTML website for deployment, run this command:
```bash
mkdocs build
```
This will generate the required HTML and CSS in a folder `./site`.

To render `mermaid` you will need to install [this plugin](https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin).
